Feminism is a diverse political ideology. You might have as many kinds of feminism as you have people who consider themselves feminists. This guide is designed as an entry point to multiple theories of feminism, including liberal feminism, womanism, Marxist feminism, radical feminism, and more. If any of those terms are new or confusing, that's okay. In addition to finding resources from each theoretical standpoint, you can find introductions to each school of thought. This includes the basic concepts, main figures, a brief timeline, and basic critques.
