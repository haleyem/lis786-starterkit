title: Learning Resources on Feminism
layout: home
---
<p>A libguide for free, open to all online resources on varied feminist politics and history.</p>
<!--so, here's what I'm thinking. Navigation at the top leads to various kinds of resources, organized by type.
the pages linked in the navigation are these separate ways of looking at theory and history. Could they link back to the pages housing the links to the resources?
kind of life wiki citations but on different pages. I'm also interested in tagging each bit with metadata like "rad" "lib" "article" "journal", etc.

    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>Feminism is a diverse political ideology. 
        You might have as many kinds of feminism as you have people who consider themselves feminists. 
        This guide is designed as an entry point to multiple theories of feminism, including liberal feminism, womanism, Marxist feminism, radical feminism, and more. 
        If any of those terms are new or confusing, that's okay. In addition to finding resources from each theoretical standpoint, you can find introductions to each school of thought. 
        This includes the basic concepts, main figures, a brief timeline, and basic critques.</p>
